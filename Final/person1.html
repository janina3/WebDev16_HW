					<h2>Bec Susan Gill</h2>
					<h4>Co-Founder and Marketing Director</h4>
					<p>Bec Susan Gill leads public outreach for digital and traditional media. Before starting ReAgency, she honed her storytelling skills as journalist for FoxNews, then later as a Creative Director for global PR firm. There, she spearheaded creative marketing efforts for brands like Microsoft, Facebook, MasterCard, Pearson English and Unilever.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					At ReAgency, Bec is also the ‘lay-person’ litmus test for all science-based productions. One of Bec’s most important roles is ensuring all messages communicate even the most complex ideas in a clear and accessible way.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Bec draws on a broad array of communications expertise – having worked in media relations for a university, where she grew a passion for working with academics to bring exciting research science to the mass media. Later, she went on to manage press for non-profit health organizations, including the World Health Organization and Unicef.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Unlike Jayde, Bec didn’t grow up with a natural love of STEM – in fact – one of her most enduring memories was locking herself in school bathrooms so as to escape the anxiety of fifth grade Math. She believes that a focus on storytelling and leveraging of popular culture has the power to insert science into the public dialogue.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Together with Jayde, Bec created the popular science channel ScIQ, where she is the co-host and Executive Producer. In 2014, the channel became a network partner under the The Young Turks Network.</p>
